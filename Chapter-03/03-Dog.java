/*
Let's start by creating the starting state of our class. We can do this by adding a class constructor to it.

1. A class constructor will allow us to create Dog instances. With a class constructor, we can set some information about the Dog.
2. If we do not create a class constructor, Java provides one that does not allow you to set initial information.

The code below demonstrates how a class constructor is created:

class Car {

  // The class constructor for the Car class
  public Car() {

  }
}

In the example above, we created a class constructor for the Car class. This constructor will be used when we create Car instances later.
*/

class Dog {

  public Dog() {
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  }

}
