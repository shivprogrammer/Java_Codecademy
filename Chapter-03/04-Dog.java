/*
Classes: Instance Variables
When we create a new class, we probably have specific details that we cant the class to include. We save those specific details into instance variables.

Here is an instance variable in the Car class that describes a detail that we might want to associate with a car:
class Car {
  // Using instance variables to model our Car class after a real-life car
  int modelYear;

  public Car() {

  }
}

In the example above, we created the instance variable named modelYear. Instance variables model real-world car attributes, such as the model year of a car. Finally, the instance variable is represented by the int data type.
