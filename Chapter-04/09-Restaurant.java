HashMap

Think of a HashMap as a real life dictionary. A dictionary contains a set of words and a definition for each word. A HashMap contains a set of keys and a value for each key.

If we look up a word in a dictionary, we can get the definition. If you provide a HashMap with a key that exiss, you can retrieve the value associated with the key.

Declaring a HashMap is shown in the following example:

HashMap<String, Integer>
myFriends = new HashMap<String, Integer>();

In the example above, we create a HashMap object called myFriends. The myFriends HashMap will store keys of String data types and values of the type Integer.

*Note: the String object allows you to store characters, such as a word in quotations (e.g. "Snapple!");

import java.util.HashMap;

public class Restaurant {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    HashMap<String, Integer>
    restaurantMenu = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
  }
}
